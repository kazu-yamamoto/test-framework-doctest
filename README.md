Test.Framework runner for DocTests
==================================

This is a work in progress library for interfacing
[test-framework](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/test-framework-0.4.0)
with [doctest](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/doctest).

Build
-----

As the doctest version in hackage does not yet provide a library api
you will need to:

    git clone git://github.com/sakari/doctest-haskell.git
    git checkout sakari/doctest-lib

And then configure, build, test and install with cabal as normal.

Usage
-----

See the generated Haddock docs for a usage example.
